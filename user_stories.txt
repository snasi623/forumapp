As an pet store owner, I want to create a space online where members of my community can post any questions they may have about owning a pet so that I can engage with them in an online discussion.
As a new pet owner, I want an online space to pose questions to my fellow pet owners regarding cost saving techniques, vet issues, and boarding options so that I can get different and diverse perspectives that will assist me in making the best decisions for my pet.
As a prospective adopter, I want to discreetly air out some of my concerns regarding caring for a dog so that I can get support from those who have faced similar fears.
